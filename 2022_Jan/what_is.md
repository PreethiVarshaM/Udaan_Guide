<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">What is Life?<br>
If not crossing the river of fire,<br>
Across the  bridge of wax,<br>
May melt in a sec.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">What is Dream?<br>
If not pursuing the beyond one,<br>
Sailing on the uncharted course,<br>
May sink far off the shore.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">What is Love?<br>
If not the shining dagger,<br>
Placed at your bare heart,<br>
May in a flick cross your heart.<br>
</p>
