<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">At the corner of the street,<br>
Under some stranger’s eave, <br>
Dressed in mismatched tatters, <br>
With a ripped-out sleeve, <br>
Sitting on the bundled woods, <br>
Covered by a torn sheet. <br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">While the cold wind blows, <br>
She holds the sheets more tight, <br>
Bulb glows over her head, <br>
For her, only source of light,<br>
Otherwise, apart from loneliness,<br>
Also a gift was the dark night.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Tightly clenched her right hand,<br>
Placed on her own heart,<br>
As if whatever it holds, <br>
She can’t dare to be apart,<br>
Was it money in her fist,<br>
Or last bit of her sweetheart.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">She looks across the path,<br>
A fire on the other side,<br>
Face lights up with pure smile,<br>
As if things were fine beside,<br>
For a moment her fist loosens,<br>
Enough for shards to shine.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Before her smile fully blooms,<br>
Before she lets shards to fall,<br>
A chilly blast of wind follows,<br>
Chilly enough for her to tremble,<br>
Fire went from flames to smoke,<br>
Unknown if they will rise from fall.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">She tightens her hold on shards,<br>
Way harder than was before,<br>
Tears at the edge of her eyes,<br>
But remembering the night ahead,<br>
She gives a dry but bright smile,<br>
</p>
