<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Standing in front of the window,<br>
Surprised to see a beauty,<br>
Peeking through her beaut eyes,<br>
Standing at the shore of the sea.<br>
Having never seen such a lady,<br>
I rubbed my eyes for reality,<br>
To my awe, nothing changed,<br>
Still she was looking at me.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">She sits down on the sand,<br>
Moving her hands gracefully,<br>
Starts to build a sand castle,<br>
While the sea was on mercy,<br>
My heart wanted me to run,<br>
Go down to beach to see,<br>
Yet I stood by the window,<br>
Afraid, she might run from me.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">After I don’t know how long,<br>
Beside the castle, stands she,<br>
In front of her castle’s gate,<br>
Were standing sand dummies three,<br>
She points the right one to herself,<br>
And the left one to me,<br>
She symbolizes with her gestures,<br>
The last one as our child to be.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">The sparkling beads on her face,<br>
And the smile on it for me,<br>
The content and love in her eyes,<br>
Heart starts to beat faster for me,<br>
Then she stretches her hand,<br>
Somehow, she stands in front of me,<br>
Keeps her palm on the window glass,<br>
To place my palm on hers, she asks me.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">The moment I place my palm on hers’,<br>
A thunder blasts from above me,<br>
Next I was all covered by sand,<br>
Standing on the beach of the sea,<br>
It felt as if all was lost,<br>
She had been snatched from me,<br>
A hole was made right through heart,<br>
Then I heard someone calling me.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">When I opened my wet eyes,<br>
I found my friend waking me,<br>
To my relief, it was a dream,<br>
Yet I wasn’t feeling whole as me,<br>
My heart was stilling missing her,<br>
My friend was staring at me,<br>
Watching me smiling at my horizon,<br>
Will I ever forget this dream beauty?<br>
</p>
