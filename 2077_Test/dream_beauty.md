Standing in front of the window,                                  
Surprised to see a beauty,                                    
Peeking through her beaut eyes,                              
Standing at the shore of the sea.                                      
Having never seen such a lady,                                  
I rubbed my eyes for reality,                           
To my awe, nothing changed,                                 
Still she was looking at me.                              
##                            
She sits down on the sand,                                            
Moving her hands gracefully,                        
Starts to build a sand castle,                                    
While the sea was on mercy,                                  
My heart wanted me to run,                       
Go down to beach to see,                         
Yet I stood by the window,                               
Afraid, she might run from me.                                  
##                            
After I don’t know how long,                          
Beside the castle, stands she,                                 
In front of her castle’s gate,                          
Were standing sand dummies three,                                 
She points the right one to herself,                              
And the left one to me,                                
She symbolizes with her gestures,                        
The last one as our child to be.                           
##                          
The sparkling beads on her face,                          
And the smile on it for me,                        
The content and love in her eyes,                                  
Heart starts to beat faster for me,                                   
Then she stretches her hand,                        
Somehow, she stands in front of me,                               
Keeps her palm on the window glass,                         
To place my palm on hers, she asks me.                     
##                                
The moment I place my palm on hers’,                         
A thunder blasts from above me,                    
Next I was all covered by sand,                          
Standing on the beach of the sea,                                
It felt as if all was lost,                       
She had been snatched from me,                     
A hole was made right through heart,                             
Then I heard someone calling me.                  
##                              
When I opened my wet eyes,                               
I found my friend waking me,                              
To my relief, it was a dream,                                     
Yet I wasn’t feeling whole as me,                                       
My heart was stilling missing her,                                     
My friend was staring at me,                                    
Watching me smiling at my horizon,                         
Will I ever forget this dream beauty?
