What is Life?                                                 
If not crossing the river of fire,                                                     
Across the  bridge of wax,                                                    
May melt in a sec.

What is Dream?                                                          
If not pursuing the beyond one,                                                           
Sailing on the uncharted course,                                                                    
May sink far off the shore.

What is Love?                                                            
If not the shining dagger,                                                        
Placed at your bare heart,                                                             
May in a flick cross your heart.
