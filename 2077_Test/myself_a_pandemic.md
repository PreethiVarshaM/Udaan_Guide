I still don’t know how and where I was born. Scientists and researchers all around the world are studying this.                     

Maybe after figuring out how I was born, they can try to restrict future births like mine. Still, human negligence and carelessness are breeding grounds for many aliens like us.                                                                

Even after discovering my existence, they didn't figure out who I am and name me. They thought I am one like many of my brothers. Little did they know that I’m not.                                                                

For the first few months, the local authorities didn’t pass any information about me to the world. But as I gradually expanded my reign and brought more people under my control, they had no choice but to put me up on the international debate.                                       
I spread like  wildfire, expanding my wings, covering all habituated continents, and crossing all waters around the globe.   

Words like quarantine, isolation, and things like masks, sanitizers,  personal health care which were buried deep underneath are now on every being.                                                   

Many locked their movements and works. The world seemed like an unbiased coin. The humanity of helping the needy increased on one hand and no humanity shown towards the deserved declined on the other.   

The intellectuals as always were esteemed at the need of the hour.  Scholars and researchers worked day and night to at least figure me out. Seems like they're devising new weapons against me, something they call vaccines.                 

But again, I am not like what they think I am. I enter them through anyway, slip away from their disinfectants in a split second, and above all, we, like human brains, are capable of changing with time, much faster than theirs.                  

It has been over half a year since their leading health organization declared me as a King, something which they spell as a pandemic.                        

But I have slowed down in many nations. But it was just a break for them. Just a small period of time to make them believe that they started to conquer me.                         

But this is intentional. It is all going as I planned. I have made the masses believe that they have kept me down. It was all going as expected. I was just waiting for them to near me and then I would hiss on them.                        

The once esteemed intellectual's warnings are now unheard of by the common folks. The price they are gonna pay is going to be huge.                

As planned, I erupted again. This time, more intense. Thanks to the people who installed overconfidence in them.      

Countries were shaken down. I have uprooted their medical system with my mighty blow. Deaths just piled up. The situation described  an apocalypse.            

There was one particular nation, India by the name. It couldn’t stand against my second flow.                

Scores of people standing in the mid sun are now seen outside every hospital. People were dying just like that, some even without knowing how they were dying.                         

The ever-free and life-fuelling gas, oxygen is now an unachievable and precious thing.                 

Never did they imagine that they would be facing such situations.               

Some interesting people also researched the positive points because  of me. I like them and I didn’t enter them.             

They said that the global pollution levels reduced because of me.They said many animals and birds are living freely because I  forced everyone to shut down.                

They said the humanity rate increased because of me.                     

But during my second attack, they were dumb silent. I was very angry with them. So now I didn’t leave them.

But one thing was quite clear. I have overthrown the supreme  boasting nature of human beings on Earth.             

I have made them incapable by making them accept their defeat in hands of a living thing that is barely visible with even the powerful microscopes they have created.                          

I have put them down to the dust.                        

One day they may defeat me, as it is evident from history, their success over my ancestors.                              

But as long as they are arrogant, as long as they are overwhelmed with their advance in technology, as long as they hurt mother Earth and other living creatures, many of my successors will shine up in this world periodically to teach them a lesson.

Ok, so I haven't disclosed my name yet right?                          

But I too am unaware of my true name. As I mentioned  before, my origins are also a big question.                   

Nevertheless, humans address me as Covid-19.  Myself a Pandemic.
