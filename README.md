# Udaan_Guide
Udaan content organization guidelines for LAC

Content on the Udaan website needs to be formatted as markdown files, and also stuctured in a proper format so that  

Commonly used formatting cheatsheet - you can find more easily at [MD Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or other similar resources. Even this is a md file open it from the heirarchy above and views its source!

   <pre>
   # Title
   ## Subheading
   *italics*
   **bold**
   ~~strikethrough~~
   > blocks
   for proper spacing try pressing enter twice inteady of once
   ![relative url dont use links]("./images/image.jpg")
   [I'm a link](https://www.google.com)
   </pre>
   
   Assuming you have a google doc with content ready, lets start! I will be using this [file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xAY5sWO4VFzWcr8P8jEPNTFvkpLjIHJ70yIDlrnJmic/edit?usp=sharing) as an example
   
   # Step 1: Starting with file contents
   This file contains an image so thats something we want to take care of first.. Make sure to source a high quality version of the image if you can and not directly the snippet from the doc. I have the original file so i will be going with that. First thing folder heirarchy - create any that dont exist
   
  <pre>  
  year_month                        (It is the year and month and must be in that format)             2077_Test
  ├───myuniquefilename.md           (name should be unique and will be used to construct page url)    prabot.md
  ├───images                        (contents in this folder will be referenced from your md file)    prabot.jpg
  │   ├───myuniquefilename.jpg
  │   └───myuniquefilename_1.jpg
  </pre>
  
   Type a folder name and then "/" to create a folder that doesn't exist 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55821103/150760607-523f93f8-c9c7-4b6d-8e4f-3866f96dad67.png)
   or upload entire folder if you are working locally
  
  # Step 2: Create a .md file
  - You can do it locally or through github ui. I will go for the latter since you can preview .md without installing anything
  - Copy the following snippet into your md file (including the dashes) and edit it
  - For "category" use any one out of 
    - Experiences
    - Op-Ed
    - Poetry
    - Campus News
    - Review
    - Competitions
  - starred will pin article on top of page if "true"
  - maintain format for the date, its only used for sorting

<pre>

title: "Why Prabhat is every human’s best friend!"
category: "Op-ed"
date: "2021-06-06 10:00:00 +09:00"
desc: "Prabhat is like the peoples president no? like how Dr Kalam was the people president everyones best friend Prabhat is ACCURATE.. This masterpiece was AI generated and will also appear on top of the article"
thumbnail: "./images/prabot.jpg"
authors: "Debeshee and Deepmind"
starred: "false"
alt: "prabot__text_if_images_fail_to_load"
---
</pre>

  - Copy paste remaining contents of your doc directly excluding any images
  - Format based on cheatsheet above
  - No need to insert title and tagline in document again these will be inserted on the website automatically!
  - Add in images using the syntax mentioned below

This is how mine looks like at this stage

The broken image will be fixed once you upload the file in the directory as mentioned! Here is me doing that
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55821103/150766424-a5fc352e-89fb-47bd-a275-1646b6e2f4a5.png)
Drag a folder named images with the jpg's into that space if there is no folder by that name to upload to!! See how it added the /images/ to the file name
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55821103/150766732-5578db30-c7b4-4c86-824b-4866a69d5f1f.png)
Commit the changes and go back to your file, it should have the image loading now

   # Step 3: Describe and submit!
